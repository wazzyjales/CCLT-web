CCLT (Cool Cat Laser Toy) web app

> An interactive remote pet engagement device built as a capstone project at Oregon Institute of Technology by **Jasmine Wales**.

The **Cool Cat Laser Toy (CCLT)** is an IoT-enabled pet device designed to bridge the gap between cats and their owners when they're apart. It combines embedded systems engineering, web development, and real-time communication to create an engaging experience for both pets and their humans.

The physical device houses a Raspberry Pi, a pet-safe laser pointer, and a camera module inside a stable enclosure positioned at an optimal height for cat interaction. When the camera detects a cat using OpenCV's detection libraries, it notifies the owner via their smartphone. The owner can then log into the web app to watch the live feed and take control of the laser — keeping their cat entertained and stimulated from anywhere.

This project addresses the common challenge pet owners face when away from home -
maintaining connection with their pets and ensuring they receive adequate stimulation and
exercise. The Cool Cat Laser Toy allows for meaningful remote interaction, reducing
separation anxiety for both pets and owners while providing necessary enrichment time for
both when there is geographical separation.
